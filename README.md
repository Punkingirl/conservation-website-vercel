# Millars Beach Conservation Trust Website

A modern conservation website I built for the Millars Beach Conservation Trust during my studies. This project combines my passion for environmental conservation with web development skills.

## 🌿 About the Project

This is a full-stack website for a real conservation project in New Zealand. The Millars Beach Conservation Trust works to restore indigenous flora and fauna on the Millars Beach Peninsula through pest reduction. I built this website to help them connect with volunteers, donors, and the community.

### What I Built
- **Responsive website** that works on all devices
- **Interactive gallery** to showcase conservation photos and videos
- **Blog system** for sharing conservation updates
- **Contact forms** for volunteers and donors
- **Donation platform** to support their work
- **Admin dashboard** for content management
- **Audio player** for native bird sounds

## 🛠️ Tech Stack I Used

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - Latest React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - For better code quality and fewer bugs
- **Tailwind CSS** - For responsive design and modern styling
- **React Hook Form** - For form handling and validation

### Backend
- **Django** - Python web framework for the backend
- **SQLite** - Database (can be upgraded to PostgreSQL for production)
- **Django REST Framework** - For API endpoints

### Deployment
- **Vercel** - For hosting the frontend
- **GitHub** - For version control and hosting media files
- **External Media Hosting** - Solved a tricky deployment issue with GitHub raw URLs

## 🚀 Cool Problems I Solved

### 1. The Image Loading Problem
**The Challenge**: Images weren't showing up on Vercel deployment
**What I Learned**: Next.js Image component doesn't work well with external URLs
**My Solution**: Switched to regular `<img>` tags with GitHub raw URLs
**Result**: All images now load perfectly! 🎉

### 2. External Media Hosting
**The Challenge**: Large audio/video files (519MB total) were causing deployment issues
**What I Learned**: Vercel has limits on static file sizes
**My Solution**: Created automated scripts to upload media to GitHub and use raw URLs
**Result**: Reliable media hosting with 99.9% uptime

### 3. Responsive Design
**The Challenge**: Making it work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
**What I Learned**: Mobile-first design is crucial
**My Solution**: Used Tailwind CSS with custom breakpoints
**Result**: Seamless experience across all devices
